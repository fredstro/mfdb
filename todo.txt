[x] Figure out what holomorphic data is in database now and in what
    form.
--> too hard; it's all burried in the middle of Python code for returning requests.  I give.

[x] Create bitbucket project for his.   Use bitbucket because it is less limited. 

    ? Create my own nosqlite? database "schema" that has at least that
      data recomputed from scratch.

    Must output "what is known" really easily.

    Data in plain text format stored in git repo.

[ ] Compute data in reproducible way.  Simple program.  Complexity of algorithm in Sage itself.

[ ] Make web interface to nosqlite database for easy and bug free use "just in case".

[ ] Expand data that is computed using more compute resources. 

[ ] Put data back into lmfdb mongodb.
